# swedish-words
 
ðŸ“œ A text file containing more than 259k Swedish words for all your dictionary/word-based projects e.g: auto-completion / autosuggestion in Swedish.

From the Swedish academys list of words. Obtained with Node.js. 

When I tried to find a list of Swedish words I didn't find anything over 1000 words. So I legally scrapped these words from https://spraakbanken.gu.se/saolhist/ . And put the words into a newline seperated txt file and json file.
