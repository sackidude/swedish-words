These are different dictionary from the swedish academy. Here is a list explaining the differences:
- SAOL(Svenska Akademins Ordlista) 1-14 are all the main Swedish dictonaries with OK defintions.
- Dalin is a dictonaries filled with old Swedish words.
- SO(Svenska Ordboken) is a collection of words with good defintions. 

I don't have the defintions BTW.
